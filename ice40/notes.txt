# chip.fail glitcher for Lattice ice40 FPGA

These are copies of the Verilog files found in Xilinx project (without the clock wizard)
adapted for the Lattice ice40 FPGA found on the Trenz IceZero with Lattice ICE40HX, 4 Mbit
external SRAM board.

Board has a 100 MHz oscilator.

# TODO

Add the testbench to Makefile (was tested manually).

$ ../../iverilog/install/bin/iverilog -o glitcher.vvp *.v
$ ../../iverilog/install/bin/vvp glitcher.vvp -ltx2
VCD info: dumpfile top_tb.vcd opened for output.
top_tb.v:29: $finish called at 3000000000 (1ps)

Check the pins on the real hardware.

Test the design on the real hardware!

Document the installation of the IceStorm tools et.al.

Using the RPi to program the FPGA.

Can the RPi be used as the serial interface (directly on the 40 pin header).
